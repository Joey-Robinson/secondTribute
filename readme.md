# Ideas

So I wanted to created something a bit different here. I went in with a general idea for 2 of the sections (Wow and Final Fantasy). 

I wanted to make the #wow section presentable with a plethora of information, but lacking in overall design and visual. I did this because similar (for the most part) to other wow related sites, the presentation isn't always the best, but the data is. I think you can see this idea come to life in the first part. I'm pulling a lot of data, but it doesn't necessarily feel overly engaging. You get the information and move on, which is exactly what I was aiming for.
