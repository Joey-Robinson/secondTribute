# Ideas

So I wanted to created something a bit different here. I went in with a general idea for 2 of the sections (Wow and Final Fantasy). 

I wanted to make the #wow section presentable with a plethora of information, but lacking in overall design and visual. I did this because similar (for the most part) to other wow related sites, the presentation isn't always the best, but the data is. I think you can see this idea come to life in the first part. I'm pulling a lot of data, but it doesn't necessarily feel overly engaging. You get the information and move on, which is exactly what I was aiming for. 

To expand on the #wow section further. I was going to pull more information so that the user would feel a sense of overwhelmingness when visiting. Again, similar to how a lot of other wow related sites are. Unless you're experienced, the information can be daunting, which again, is what I wanted to aim for. 

I decided against this for two reasons:
  1. I didn't want there to much too much information. Meaning while I wanted there to be a lot of information present, I wanted a user to understand what they were looking at. This meant I needed to cut some information and I decided to cut talents.
  2. The second reason is simple; I didn't want to setup OAuth for something like this. I didnt' feel it was warranted so I decided not to, and since I didn't want to set it up, it loops back to number one, making the choice even easier.

For the next section, the #finalfantasy section, I wanted something a bit more visual, but with less overall data.
