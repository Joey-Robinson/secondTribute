    livingWith: "The Maine Coonâ€™s nutrition should be carefully controlled. This breed has a tendency to become soft or overweight if not carefully monitored. The Maine Coon must have adequate exercise. Cat trees and perches should be available and she needs adequate running room. She loves interactive play and she will play with every family member. Being a larger and heavier cat, she can knock things over without meaning to do so. The Maine Coon's coat needs daily attention. She should be brushed to make certain that her fur does not tangle, and she should be combed to smooth her coat. Usually this grooming is easy to do if she is trained at a young age that this is fun.",
    history: "The Maine Coon cat is considered the only longhair breed native to the United States. This breed probably was introduced by seamen who sailed into New England. The cats they carried on their ships most likely left the ship either permanently or just for a little shore leave, bred with the existing native cats, and ultimately created a breed of their own. The show career for the Maine Coon cat began in New York in 1895 when the best cat award was given to a tabby Maine Coon named Leo. Leo kept winning at the Boston cat shows until 1900 when he was defeated by his own son. After this, the love affair with the Persian began, and the Maine Coon cat dropped into second place in popularity. This ranking has changed once again in recent years and the Maine Coon is now once again America's Cat."
